# Project-Management-

Overview of the Project: 

Predicting house prices.
Explain the features and target variable (Price).

Objective of the Project:

The goal of this project is to understand the entire pipeline of a machine learning model — from data collection, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and improvement — using a real-world dataset. The project focuses on predicting house prices based on various features (such as square footage, number of rooms, etc.).

Key Features of the Project;

Load the dataset using Pandas.
Explore the data: head(), describe(), info(), value_counts().
Identify the target variable (Price) and features (such as square footage, number of rooms, etc.).
Visualize the data (use basic plots with Matplotlib and Seaborn).
